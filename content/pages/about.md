I'm a 24 years old engineering student from Lille in northern France interested in technologies,
our planet and social impact.

I studied at Centrale Lille, a general engineering school in which I developed my problem resolution skills.
In my last year I focused on Data Science, learning about models to predict outcomes. 
I now wish to develop those skills in a professional context but also bring valuable insights from data.
